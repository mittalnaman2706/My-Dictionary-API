# Google Dictionary API

Google does not provide API for Google Dictionary so I created one.

## Getting Started

### Usage 

The basic syntax of a URL request to the API is shown below:

https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/<--version-->/entries/<--language_code-->/<--word-->

As an example, to get definition of English word **hello** using _v2_, you can send request to

https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/hello, result returned will be,

```json
[
    {
        "word": "hello",
        "phonetic": "/həˈlō/",
        "origin": "Early 19th century variant of earlier hollo; related to holla.",
        "meanings": [
            {
                "partOfSpeech": "exclamation",
                "definitions": [
                    {
                        "definition": "Used as a greeting or to begin a telephone conversation.",
                        "example": "hello there, Katie!"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "partOfSpeech": "noun",
                "definitions": [
                    {
                        "definition": "An utterance of “hello”; a greeting.",
                        "example": "she was getting polite nods and hellos from people",
                        "synonyms": [
                            "greeting",
                            "welcome",
                            "salutation",
                            "saluting",
                            "hailing",
                            "address",
                            "hello",
                            "hallo"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "partOfSpeech": "intransitive verb",
                "definitions": [
                    {
                        "definition": "Say or shout “hello”; greet someone.",
                        "example": "I pressed the phone button and helloed"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Language support

The API supports multiple language, you can query any language supported by sending its language code.

For example you can get definition of French word **Bonjour** in _v2_ format by sending request to,

https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/fr/bonjour

```json
[
    {
        "word": "bonjour",
        "phonetic": "",
        "origin": "",
        "meanings": [
            {
                "partOfSpeech": "nom masculin",
                "definitions": [
                    {
                        "definition": "Souhait de bonne journée (adressé en arrivant, en rencontrant).",
                        "example": "",
                        "synonyms": [
                            "salut"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```


List of languages supported can be found [here](https://dictionaryapi.dev/languageCode.txt) for your reference.

### Regarding V1 Version
The API earlier use to send response as shown below, but this structure of response was found out to be difficult to work with (you can take a look at these tickets [#32](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI/issues/32) and [#4](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI/issues/4)), based on feedback in these tickets I have updated the API to _v2_ version. _v2_ version is available for all languages supported. That said, _v1_ version will always be supported for backward compatibility.

```json
[
  {
    "word": "hello",
    "phonetic": [
      "həˈləʊ",
      "hɛˈləʊ"
    ],
    "meaning": {
      "exclamation": [
        {
          "definition": "used as a greeting or to begin a telephone conversation.",
          "example": "hello there, Katie!"
        }
      ],
      "noun": [
        {
          "definition": "an utterance of ‘hello’; a greeting.",
          "example": "she was getting polite nods and hellos from people"
        }
      ],
      "verb": [
        {
          "definition": "say or shout ‘hello’.",
          "example": "I pressed the phone button and helloed"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
